# Diamond Price Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict diamond prices based on relevant features. The goal is to develop a reliable model that accurately estimates diamond prices, leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Project Steps

### STEP 1: Project Initialization
- Define the scope and objectives of the project.

### STEP 2: Data Collection
- Collect and gather the required data for diamond price prediction.

### STEP 3: Data Preprocessing
#### Data Cleaning:
- **Correcting:** Address outliers and aberrant values, ensuring data integrity.
- **Completing:** Handle missing values if any (skip if none).
- **Creating:** Skip, as there's no need for creating new features.
- **Converting:** Deal with label encoding for categorical variables.

### STEP 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Statistics
- Explore relationships between discrete variables and the dependent variable.
- Visualizations:
  - Histograms.
  - Density graphs.
  - Evaluate the relationships of dependent variables with the target variable.
  - Correlation matrix.

### STEP 5: Modeling Data
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Use pipelines to choose the best algorithm for the data.
- Make predictions with the selected algorithm.
- Model Tuning:
  - Optimize parameters for the best algorithm.
  - Predict with the tuned final model.
